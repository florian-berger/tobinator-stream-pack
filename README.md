This small modpack introduces a few items to the game, that really make the game feel a little bit more evolved. It's a Vanilla+ style modpack, introducing not that many new items and blocks.

The pack adds:
- Gravestones
- Possibility of fully automated storage system
- Shader (via Iris)
- Backpacks
- More crafting possibilities (slabs to origin block, ...)
- Some other visual improvements

The pack was created for the German YouTuber and streamer [TobinatorLP](http://tobinatorlp.de/). To enable the community to play with the same configurations easily, the modpack was uploaded to CurseForge.
